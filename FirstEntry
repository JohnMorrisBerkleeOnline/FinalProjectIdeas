For my final project, I would like to create a database for storing songs in my setlist. I would like them to be categorized in several ways- style, key, artist, and alphabetical. I will do this using a table. I think it would also be cool to assign each style a different color.


Ballad-Purple

Waltz-Blue

Straight-Green

Swing-Red

Shuffle-Orange


COMPONENTS:


Title

Table

Field for song name

Field for artist

Field for style

Field for key
